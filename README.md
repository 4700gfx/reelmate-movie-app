# Purpose of The Application

This application was created to provide movie and show watchers information on their favorite shows while providing a way to make a list of movies and shows you would like to see in the future. 

We want the v1 to include Movie List, Comprehensive Searches, Recommendations based on your current list, and adding your friends to see their list and create lists together. With future versions, we want to include review sections with comments in which you and your friends can be able to comment and review on together. 

Once this is done, we will work towards creating a Mobile Version of this app and make it available to others for a low price due to the cost of using the API. These different functionalities will be highlighted below.

# Most Viable Features

1. Searching for Movies, TV Shows and Actors 
2. Creating and Deleting List for Movies, TV Shows and Actors
3. Signing In and Saving Lists
4. Adding Friends and Viewing Each Others List

These features will allow us to easily deploy and continue to develop on the first version of Reelmates. This project will be continually updated and worked on until the following versions of Reelmates are created/released. 

- Mobile Styling and Support 
- Adding Reviews and Comments 
- Photo Generation for No Images
